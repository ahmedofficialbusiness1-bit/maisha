## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Green (#33691E) to reflect agriculture, growth, and wealth. The choice of green reflects the game's theme centered around building an African economic empire starting from the basics, like farming. Avoids literal associations to money.
- Background color: Light Green (#E8F5E9). This provides a soft, neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the main content.
- Accent color: Golden Yellow (#FFB300) for highlighting key actions and important information. This draws the user's eye and is also an earth-toned color like the green.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that is readable and modern.
- Use clean and modern icons that are representative of African industry and culture.
- Design a modular layout that adapts to different screen sizes, emphasizing clear data presentation.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback and enhance the user experience during key interactions such as production and trading.
